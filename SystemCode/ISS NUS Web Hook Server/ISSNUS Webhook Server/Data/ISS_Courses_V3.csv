We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and people’s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.
AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form of deep learning.
The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI’s huge impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area – natural language processing (NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).
In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation, machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.
This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder models, reinforcement learning, etc.

As more organisations adopt cloud-based systems, new complexities and challenges surface. To ensure that cloud security professionals have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to audit, assess and secure cloud infrastructures, (ISC)² and the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) recently developed the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSPSM).
The CCSP credential reflects in-depth knowledge derived from hands-on information security and cloud computing experience. It validates practical know-how for professionals whose responsibilities involve cloud security architecture, design, operations and service orchestration.
CCSP defines the qualifications and experience necessary to competently secure cloud services. Ultimately, it provides a new benchmark for cloud security knowledge and competence and is viewed as the most reliable indicator of overall proficiency in cloud security. 
This course is part of the Cybersecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

As organisations embrace the digital revolution, so do cyber criminals. Malicious cyber activities have evolved in sophistication, and stealth and teamwork are required to counter this. Not only cybersecurity professionals, ICT professionals too need to play their part in helping their organisations protect their assets from the ever-pervasive cyber threats.
The objective of this course is not to turn ICT professionals into cybersecurity professionals, but to equip them with sufficient cybersecurity knowledge so that they can incorporate security into their work at the outset rather than as an afterthought or, worse still, not at all.
This course is not recommended for those who have already attended NICF- AISP Qualified Information Security Professional Course

In our current digitally disrupted era, cybersecurity has now become more critical and the stakes are much higher. Daily cyber attack occurrences demonstrate the risks posed by cyber-threats – from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.
Investing in cyber technology alone to address cyber threats is no longer sufficient. The biggest risks of cyber attack lies in the effective management of humans – the weakest link in cyber threat. This requires putting in place the right governance and the right supporting processes, along with the right enabling cyber technology. Such complexity cannot be an excuse for anyone within an organisation to differ accountability and responsibility to technical “experts” – the cybersecurity professionals. It is essential that the organisation takes control of allocating the right resources to address cyber threats, actively manage governance, risk and responses to cyber threats and incidents. This includes creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility – no exception.
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

As mobile adoption grows, so do security threats. Mobile devices are already an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and tablets in this year.
Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these applications create.
This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security architecture for businesses. 
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS","Upcoming Classes

With Singapore’s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy (CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats posed by cyber threats – from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.
In today’s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats. Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.
This course is designed to provide you with the necessary skills to implement the right cybersecurity strategy and action plans, taking into considerations your business environment, your business and the potential cyber threats that will affect the business operations in the digital economy. In addition, it provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience will also be discussed.
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment. 
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints. 
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 10 PDUs (Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting, the PMI® REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

As Singapore progresses into a Smart Nation, Internet of Things (IoT) devices will be ubiquitous. Imagine a world where millions of devices are connected - we eventually will be seeing, hearing and sensing information via the Internet and improve productivity and the quality of human life. With this, comes challenges with IoT security as the next frontier in Cybersecurity.
Smart City and Industry 4.0 Solutions are highly dependent on Internet of Thing (IoT) devices as the key source of data. To have good data integrity and quality at the IoT devices (at the source), the security of the IoT devices is a key consideration in its deployment.
This is a 2-day course where participants are expected to come with an appreciation for IoT and build the security aspect upon it. Through the use of a case study, we will apply risk analysis methodology to assess the risk and design security controls to protect the IoT solutions while ensuring operational effectiveness and efficiency.
This course is part of the Software Systems series, Cybersecurity series and Digital Strategy & Leadership series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Business Analytics has earned a place as one of the core disruptors of the digital age. Many companies’ business analytics initiatives have moved to production, with some proven success, and now there is a continuing push to leverage new data technologies to power business intelligence. Many government agencies and private companies have jumped on this bandwagon and are heavily investing in business analytics projects to gain new insights in order to acquire a competitive edge to serve their customers and citizens.
According to Gartner Research, the worldwide market for analytics will remain the top focus for CIOs through 2017.

There has been an increasing demand for business analytics, especially in the recent years and this trend is set to experience a continual rise. Predictive analytics is one of the most important areas of business analytics. It is all about extracting information from data and using it to predict future trends and behaviour patterns in businesses. In other words, predictive analytics offers actionable business predictions through mining abundant historical data. It has been widely used in many industries such as banking, insurance, telecom, retail, travel, health care and has shown significant impact on planning and business decision making. Many companies have been turning to predictive analytics to thrive and compete against their competitors.
This course will directly help participants utilise business data more effectively by deriving insights of trends and irregularities from data and applying them for forward-looking predictions. This is realised through building predictive models with appropriate analytical techniques. Ultimately, the company will gain a competitive advantage over its competitors as it would become more proactive in the way it does business and marketing and thereby reduce cost and increase return on investments.
The objective of this course is to introduce participants to the concepts, methods and techniques of predictive analytics. Participants will gain the requisite skills to perform predictive analytics in real-life business scenarios through workshops using either R or SPSS or JMP. The course will assume that the participants have some preliminary knowledge of statistical concepts like regression and logistic regression and some hands on experience of modelling using these techniques, though the course will revisit these concepts to refresh the theory. In case participants have no prior statistical knowledge, it is strongly recommended that they attend the NICF-Statistics Bootcamp (SF) prior to attending this course.
This course is part of the Data Science and Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics Practice Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Everyday decisions, from which products to buy, movies to watch and restaurants to try, are more and more being put in the hands of a new source: recommendation systems. Recommendation systems work by studying the past behaviours and purchases of users along with their preferences and product ratings. Using these and other relevant data they are able to provide recommendations and choices of interest to users in terms of “Relevant Job postings”, “Movies of Interest”, “Suggested Videos”, “People who bought this also bought this” etc.
Recommender systems have been widely used by online shopping companies such as Amazon.com. They play a critical role in analysing customer transactions and web browsing behaviours to provide sound recommendations for their customers, contributing to sales revenue and profitability. In this regard, a reliable and efficient recommendation system is essential for many companies’ market and business success.

It is not enough to just employ social media tools. The ability to analyse and understand their impact, is fast becoming a business imperative. The insights embedded within social media can empower your organisation to make intelligent business decisions. These can lead to improvements in your customer and employee loyalty and in maximising the value of your efforts in sales, marketing, customer service, employee relations and product development. By understanding what your customers think about your organisations, products and services, you can then act quickly and remain competitive.
The Social Media Analytics course will help you to analyse and understand the impact of social media. These include:
What is the direct value of your Facebook page?
What is the ROI through your Twitter?
How to measure the impact of business metrics from your website or blog?

With the massive volume and unrelenting continuity of social media, content can be overwhelming. How does a business make sense of it? How can you act upon the trends and sentiments within? And more crucially, how do you deliver the right social media intelligence to the right people at the right time to gain a competitive advantage?
During this course, you will learn how to effectively utilise social media analytics to create value for your organisation in the different departments which include:
Marketing:
Measure the value of social media to justify a capital investment
Integrate and implement an end-to-end social media strategy
Provide insights into current campaigns and improve on future ones
Sales:

Do you know how to analyse customer sentiments about your company, products and services? Or how to keep track of your company’s service & quality delivery so that you are able to act quickly to insights that drive your business?
About 80% of enterprise-relevant data is in unstructured or semi-structured format. These include emails, documents, surveys, feedback forms, warranty claims, contact-centre notes and transcripts, web pages, news, data from social media, audios, videos and many more. A predominant amount of such data is available as text.
In order to gain competitive edge in the market, businesses and organisations are finding a growing need to expand their analysis scope to cover text data, especially in regards to customer feedback and social media data. This is so that critical insights can be uncovered to support business decision making and process improvement.
This course aims to equip you with the knowledge and skills to effectively analyse large amounts of textual data such as customer feedback and social media conversations to discover themes, patterns and trends to aid in improving business process and decision making. In scenario-based case studies, you will be introduced to common text analytics tasks such as data pre-processing and preparation, linguistic/knowledge resources management, concept extraction, text categorisation, clustering, association and trend analysis. You will practise performing these tasks following a well-defined process in hands-on sessions.
This 3-day data mining course focuses on introducing the essential analytical skills in modelling unstructured textual data such as customer feedback, reviews or comments to business and IT professionals.
This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence, Graduate Certificate in Business Analytics Practice and Graduate Certificate in Practice Language Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS.
This course need only be taken once throughout the Stackable Programme in Data Science.","Upcoming Classes

We are in an era where AI and analytics are transforming industries and people’s life at an unprecedented pace. In the recently released report from Gartner, Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2018, the top two trends are AI Foundation, and Intelligent Apps and Analytics.
AI Foundation focuses on creating systems that learn, adapt and potentially act autonomously, and leveraging AI to enhance decision making, reinvent business models and ecosystems, and remake the customer experience. The technologies and techniques in AI Foundation have grown substantially over the years, as the availability of massive amounts of data has fed machine learning, resulting in the flourishing of more advanced algorithms in the form of deep learning.
The second trend, Intelligent Apps and Analytics, clearly states AI’s huge impact in the next-generation data and analytics paradigm, Augmented Analytics. Machine learning is key in this new paradigm, automating data preparation, insight discovery and insight sharing for a broad range of end-users and citizen data scientists, while expert data scientists focusing on specialized problems and on embedding models into applications. The need to perform processing on natural language data is reflected in the illustrated paradigm, identifying three tasks in this area – natural language processing (NLP), natural language query (NLQ), natural language generation (NLG).
In the field of NLP, deep learning techniques has taken a dominant position over tradition statistical methods. Researchers have been reporting much higher performance metrics applying deep learning to solve problems like text classification, language modeling, speech recognition, caption generation, machine translation, document summarization, question answering, etc.
This course, Text Processing Using Machine Learning, provides essential knowledge and skills required to perform deep learning based text processing in common tasks encountered in industries. A combination of lectures, case studies, and workshops will be used to cover the application of DL techniques such as word-embedding, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), LSTMs, character-based language modelling, encoder-decoder models, reinforcement learning, etc.
This course is part of the Artificial Intelligence and Graduate Certificate in Practical Language Processing Series offered by NUS-ISS.",,"Key Takeaways

Service analytics describes the process of capturing, processing and analysing the data generated from the execution of a service system to improve, extend, and personalise a service to create value for both providers and customers. 
Service analytics also covers process analytics and will be useful for those who are managing processes and quality in service industries. 
The methodologies taught in this course are applicable to many industries including IT Services, public services (e.g. Government agencies), Healthcare, Finance Institutions (Retail Banking & Insurance), Airlines, Logistics, Transport, Hotel, Tourism, Consumer services, etc. 
An organisation’s innovation potential depends on its capability to process ‘data’ about internal operations and the world outside the organization. 
The scope of this analytics-based capability is constantly expanded by the development of new technologies making the generation, collection, and analysis of data much easier. 
For many industries, more data and the ability to analyse that data in a scientific manner, provide an opportunity to optimise, innovate, and differentiate for growth and greater efficiency. This capability based on data analytics is emerging as a critical factor to achieve competitive advantage. 
This course is part of the Data Science and Graduate Certificate in Advanced Predictive Modelling Techniques Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Scrum is a process framework that has been used to manage complex product development since the early 1990s. The Product Owner is responsible for maximising the value of the product and the work of the development team. Some of the work a Product Owner does includes defining the product backlog, prioritising them and making sure that development team understand the items clearly. 
The Certified Scrum Product Owner course will empower you with the knowledge and tools to excel in this role. Conducted by Certified Scrum Trainer Pete Deemer, it consists of lectures modules and case-study-based exercises with ample open discussions and Q & A opportunities.
This course is not recommended for those who have already attended NICF - Business Analysis for Agile Practitioner course.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership, Digital Agility and Digital Products & Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 9 PDUs (PM: 9) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Do you feel that your IT processes (e.g. for projects, software development, operations, infra management etc) are too complex, too bureaucratic, too slow, have too much documentation and don’t satisfy your users and customers? 
One good way to improve this situation is to make use of Lean IT best practices.
Lean IT is the extension of Lean principles applied to IT products and services. Lean IT can be interpreted as an IT process improvement strategy; a way to design, transform and run the IT business so as to maximise customer value and reduce waste. It focuses on improving value, efficiency and speed, through reduction of waste within the value delivery processes of an IT organisation. 
The Lean concept has a great impact on the culture of an organisation as it empowers employees to participate in the optimisation of processes. The principles of Lean IT are applicable to all organisations with IT operations regardless of industry or sector.
Lean IT is complementary to other frameworks and methods such as ITIL®, PMP®, CMMI® and COBIT®. These frameworks provide guidelines on best-practice processes but do not provide much guidance on how the implementation details of the processes can be optimised to reduce waste and increase value to the customer/user. Lean IT provides this complementary aspect. 
Lean IT is also complementary to agile methods such as SCRUM. For example, SCRUM recommends reflecting on completed SCRUM processes for improvement (e.g. via sprint retrospective) but SCRUM does not give much guidance on how to improve. Again, Lean IT provides this complementary aspect.
Lean companies are arguably more successful than non-lean companies in terms of business value and retaining talent, and their success is more sustainable over time.
This course teaches Lean IT Foundation principles and concepts. Class exercises, workshops and quiz are used extensively to reinforce the participants' understanding and practice of the concepts as well as assess the competence of the participants. The course also includes the Lean IT Foundation Exam which leads to the Lean IT Foundation Certificate for successful participants.
The 60-minute, 40 questions, multiple-choice Lean IT Foundation certificate exam is scheduled on the last day of the course.
Upon completion of this course, participants would be able to:
Broaden their skills on process improvement with a strong emphasis on focusing on value as seen from the customer’s perspective
Minimising waste and producing more efficient IT services, which in turn benefits the organisation
This course is part of the Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 14.5 PDUs (PM: 10.5, Leadership: 2, Business: 2) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Many organisations develop software using an Agile methodology.
An Agile software development approach is characterised by iterative and incremental development to achieve significant productivity benefits, such as faster time-to-market and cost & time savings.
The Agile approach's benefits to the organisation are:
Increased ability to plan and deliver changes based on business priorities
Greater responsiveness with the ability to respond to changing priorities or urgent updates
Higher visibility of progress to all stakeholders
The confidence that they are building the right solutions by allowing them to explore new ideas and test them quickly with significantly less effort and cost
A delivery process that significantly lowers the risk of delivery, compared to traditional 'big bang' releases at the end of a long project
Improved ability to commit to and meet delivery deadlines
The ability to deliver new functionalities to their customers faster and with less lead time
A software testing practice that follows the principles of Agile software development is called 'Agile Testing'. An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project teams.
Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so, the product's quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and defects early.
This three-day course will provide training and testing activities related to Agile projects and on applying tools and techniques to ensure that software products meet the accepted quality level (AQL).
Advantages of Agile Testing:
Improves quality
Saves time and money
Reduces documentation
Team gets regular feedback from end users

Business agility refers to the ability of an organisation to succeed in a rapidly changing environment, by providing the required culture and supporting practices. Business agility builds upon practices that are widely used in software development to improve efficiency and speed to market and innovation.
The benefits of enhanced agility include higher revenues, more satisfied customers and employees, improved operational efficiency and faster time-to-market.
Business agility, hence, must be addressed organisation-wide and not be limited to IT, although IT serves as the key enabler of digital transformation. Agile organisations that are effective are both stable (resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive). Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be better at innovation, according to the best research.
This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile organisational culture will be discussed. We will discuss best practices for managing change as the organisation carries out its transition from the current to the desired Agile state.
This course is designed for use in a Bootcamp, which can be tailored for specific organisational needs, and a part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Today, more organisations are adopting Agile development and the trend is expected to continue. Agile development streamlines process overhead and improves predictability through better risk management.
Some popular Agile flavours today include Scrum and XP. Although these flavours describe in details the steps in Agile development, they do not elaborate on how to manage the requirements. This Business Analysis for Agile Practitioners course has been designed to introduce participants to the entire Agile development process, with a focus on requirements.
Through this course, participants will also be equipped with knowledge and skills to effectively perform business analysis in Agile projects. Participants will learn how to write and validate user stories. They will also be engaged in hands-on sessions to help facilitate and enhance the learning process.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS, and is not recommended for those who have already attended NICF - Certified ScrumMaster course or Certified Scrum Product Owner course.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn:
13 Professional Development hours (PD Hours) for the initial CBAP® application and Continuing Development Units (CDUs) for re-certification under IIBA®
10 Professional Development Units (PDUs) (PM: 10) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential.
Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Whether you are in IT or Project management, application development or IT infra/operations, the growing business demand for ever faster time-to-market means that you now need to know DevOps and BizOps, in addition to Agile. 
While Agile caters only to development work, DevOps and BizOps will cater to the whole end-to-end IT work process.
DevOps (an international best practice) caters to an agile/lean, automated end-to-end process for application development/enhancement work - starting from development work and extending to the downstream IT infra/operations work (e.g. infra setup, deployment and operations/monitoring). 
BizOps caters to an agile/lean process for business needs that are directly catered for by IT infra/ops and IT/project managers without involvement of software developers. These can be new services (e.g. implementation of new infra such as IoT sensor network), upgrade of existing services (e.g. upgrade of wifi network) and work relating to existing services (e.g. service requests, incident management etc.) 
While most DevOps courses touch indirectly on BizOps, this course will explicitly cover BizOps in addition to DevOps so as to provide a coverage of lean/agile across all IT services and the roles that all the different IT management/specialists play in it as well as tools that are important to such agility.
As DevOps and BizOps do not have a widely-recognised, de-facto certification body or international standard as yet, this course captures and integrates international best practices from the industry (e.g. from companies such as Spotify) so as to provide useful and practical foundational competencies in DevOps and BizOps.
You will earn 17.5 PDUs (Technical : 17.5) upon successful completion of this course. For the purpose of PDU reporting, the ISS PMI® REP Provider Number is “2339”.

We are in a time of unprecedented change, known as the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’. It is characterised by the digital transformation of our world and the unavoidable interaction between humans, digital technologies and physical assets. It is an increasingly fast paced and complex environment, requiring organizations to be more agile, better equipped to adapt what they do and ready to adopt new ways of working to succeed.
ITIL 4, through its framework, helps organizations to connect and align these different challenges that are relevant not only to ITSM professionals, but also by a wider range of professionals working in the digital world.
ITIL 4 expands previous versions by providing a practical and flexible basis to support organizations on their journey to the new world of digital transformation. It provides an end-to-end IT/digital operating model for the delivery and operation of tech-enabled products and services and enables IT teams to continue to play a crucial role in wider business strategy.
ITIL 4 supports the existing investment that people and organizations have made into ITIL, as it is an expansion on the existing framework. That investment is protected because ITIL 4 provides a practical and flexible transition that helps organizations adopt the new ways of working brought by the modern digital world.
This course is part of the Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 13.5 PDUs (PM: 11, Business: 2.5) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Nb: The course has two versions – a special healthcare version, and a normal default version for all industry sectors. The details of the two versions are described below.
Version for all industries:
When we have difficult digitalisation problems to solve, it pays to have good frameworks and methods to allow the problem to be worked through systematically and successfully. For example, techniques to cater to
Complicated problems such as 
tough technical problems (e.g. a mission critical system is down) where experts have difficulty finding the root cause 
Complex problems such as 
improving an organisation for which its mission-critical digital services fail repeatedly over time, and the organisation is not able to improve and minimise such incidents 
methods to handle an environment that is VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) such as to achieve digital transformation and/or create successful new digital services in spite of the VUCA environment or market 
analysing and creating or improving a complex stakeholder ecosystem for a digital service 
Chaotic problems such as 
Major incidents, disasters or crisis causing significant chaos to the organisation and its digital services 
This course will provide systems thinking and root cause analysis skills to cater to the above.
Techniques covered will include Kepnor Tregoe; analysis and change of systems behaviour (e.g. via System Archetypes, causal loop mapping and ecosystem analysis and design); analysis and change of people behaviour (e.g. via understanding and changing mental models, understanding and working with cognitive biases, allies and adversaries analysis and approach); Cyenfin Framework approaches to complicated, complex and chaotic problems and how these are manifested in techniques such as Sense-making, Lean Startup and Design Thinking as well as in other techniques. Workshops will allow the participants to gain the skills in relevant approaches.
Health Services Version:
For practitioners working in healthcare or social care, the specially tailored ‘Systems Thinking and Root Cause Analysis for Health Services’ version of this course will be most relevant. The course will teach the tools and strategies to help inform decision making in complex situations and especially help participants grapple with the unique challenges associated with care settings.
The health services course includes application of tools and strategies to integrated care models as well as mapping different decision-making domains to the macro, meso and micro levels of healthcare systems. The course is designed to support participants in framing their challenges within the macro level of the system, and scoping their solutions down to meso or micro levels.
‘Systems Thinking and Root Cause Analysis for Health Services’ is offered as a standalone course. It is also one of the five stackable training courses that make up the NUS Professional Diploma in Smart Health Leadership. Upon completion of all five stackable training courses, participants are expected to undertake a capstone project in order to achieve the Professional Diploma award.
This course is part of the Digital Agility as well as the Professional Diploma in Smart Health Leadership offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

This 3-day introductory course focuses on the principles and techniques in the design of good user experience in software applications. It traverses through the requirement, analysis, design and validation phases of the user experience design life cycle with emphasis on building empathy with users. Case scenarios, examples, exercises and workshops will be used throughout the course for participants to individually experience and reflect on what is good and bad UX design.
Designing for applications is about more than just usability. It is also about how well a particular application is able to relate, interact and serve for a meaningful experience. Good user experience encourages a higher engagement rate and sustained use of the applications. It also renders a beneficial experience for the user, which can lead to an increase in productivity. Bad user experience often leads to a myriad of issues and arguably one of the most damaging, is to the organisation’s or company’s image.
This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

It is not enough to just employ social media tools. The ability to analyse and understand their impact, is fast becoming a business imperative. The insights embedded within social media can empower your organisation to make intelligent business decisions. These can lead to improvements in your customer and employee loyalty and in maximising the value of your efforts in sales, marketing, customer service, employee relations and product development. By understanding what your customers think about your organisations, products and services, you can then act quickly and remain competitive.
The Social Media Analytics course will help you to analyse and understand the impact of social media. These include:
What is the direct value of your Facebook page?
What is the ROI through your Twitter?
How to measure the impact of business metrics from your website or blog?
If you launch a social media campaign, how effective is the campaign?
With the massive volume and unrelenting continuity of social media, content can be overwhelming. How does a business make sense of it? How can you act upon the trends and sentiments within? And more crucially, how do you deliver the right social media intelligence to the right people at the right time to gain a competitive advantage?
During this course, you will learn how to effectively utilise social media analytics to create value for your organisation in the different departments which include:
Marketing:
Measure the value of social media to justify a capital investment
Integrate and implement an end-to-end social media strategy
Provide insights into current campaigns and improve on future ones
Sales:
Develop personalised offers that resonate with customers to increase sales
Product management:
Understand consumers in new markets and their specific cultural attributes
Develop and evolve products and solutions from direct social media analysis
Customer service:
Understand real customer issues and identify trends versus one-of-a-kind issues
Respond to and resolve customer issues before they become major problems
Through this course, you will not only learn to interpret the social media data gathered using social media monitoring tools but also, make sense of these data in order to take effective actions.
This course is part of the Digital Innovation & Design series and Data Science series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

The introduction of new technologies and the continual evolution of existing IT systems presents incredible opportunities and simultaneous challenges to the modern organisation. Technology alone cannot transform a business. It is critical that the people involved in the implementation and utilisation of new solutions are willing to embrace them as well. An understanding of change management principles can greatly improve the project manager’s chance of success in introducing IT or digital change.
In a rapidly changing business environment driven by IT and digitalisation, the ability for a business to continually adapt to take advantage of new opportunities requires the development of a strong change culture and a skilled, change-ready workforce. This not only helps to ensure success but just as critically helps to avoid being left behind and rendered obsolete. The effective application of change management and communication techniques to IT and digitisation projects will significantly improve the chance of success for change initiatives. Thus, managers who are leading change management project teams must be equipped with the necessary skills and appropriate toolkit to embark on the transformation journey.
This course draws extensively upon the practitioner experience of our lecturers. Having delivered complex, large scale change programmes locally and internationally, our course lecturers will share the frameworks and tools they have applied in industry settings. In the process, common pitfalls will be highlighted, with expert advice on how to overcome or avoid them.
The course is designed to address the particular challenges associated with the implementation of new IT systems or technologies, although the principles of change management, and the frameworks taught, could be applicable for all change management situations. The programme is delivered using blended learning techniques including experiential role-play, and hinges around IT case study activities to support participants in practical application of the skills taught.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Products & Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS. Series offered by NUS-ISS.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19.5 PDUs (Business: 12.5, Leadership: 7) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.",,"Key Takeaways

Project managers are focused on completing a project and handing-off to operations. Product managers, on the other hand, need to continually evolve the product and grow market share. 
In a fast changing IT landscape accelerated by disruptive technologies, technology driven products and services are impacting the way business is run. The typical project model alone is unable to support these new developments. Organisations need to adopt and adapt a product thinking mindset for the business to survive. Project managers and IT professionals would need product thinking concepts and techniques to bridge the gap and stay relevant.
This 2-day course is targeted for professionals who want to learn about and apply product thinking concepts, processes and tools in delivering systems, services or products for the business or for the internal organisation and teams. 
This course is part of the Digital Products & Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS.
You will earn 8.5 PDUs (Technical: 4, Strategic: 4.5) upon successful completion of this course. For the purpose of PDU reporting, the ISS PMI® REP Provider Number is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

They must have a broad knowledge base to in-order to make trade-off decisions, bring together cross-functional teams while ensuring alignment between diverse functions within the organisation.

Managing the common challenges including rapid urbanisation, building a fundamentally sound financial sector or fostering entrepreneurship and innovation, requires effective governance. Technology is an enabler and essential tool in delivering good governance as it facilitates transparency, accountability, efficiency and productivity. 
Participants in this course will learn the key principles needed for the development of IT policies and standards that will support scalability, security, inter-operability, data exchange and integration. It will introduce a framework that enables participants to acquire the skills in identifying IT opportunities and prioritise them. It will also explore how proper IT planning creates long-term business value while optimising IT resources for the organisation – be it for a ministry or department. 
Techniques like sense-making will be introduced to help develop technological options for different scenarios. The options will be analysed with an assessment of the range of outcomes in order to select a best course of action that achieves the goals of the organisation. 
Strategies for technology acquisition will be discussed. These include considerations for “build”, “buy” or “outsource” decisions, defining and measuring outcome-based service levels and public private partnership models.
Design Thinking seeks to stimulate creative thinking to accelerate effective synthesis of policy, process and technology solutions. Participants will learn concepts of design thinking that will lay the foundation of transformation and help focus on citizens and businesses. Topics on stakeholder management, effective communication and transformational leadership will be introduced and discussed. 
The deployment of new technologies, systems, processes will invariably impact the stakeholders and result in changes. Communication of such changes need to be planned carefully so as to ensure human inertia and resistance are overcome, leading to accelerated adoption of the change. Discussion will include critical role of Change Champions, who lead transformation and interactions across administrative compartments in the public sector, stakeholders and interface between public administration and businesses and citizens at large.
IT Governance and Risk Management is the management of the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operations, involvement and influence of IT within an organisation. This segment will highlight the importance of having a sound governance process in managing the IT investment with all stakeholders involved in the decision-making process. Compliance to relevant laws, regulations, contractual agreements and policies will also be discussed.
This programme is designed for extensive interaction and discussions to facilitate exchange of ideas amongst practitioners and experiential learning.

As more organisations adopt cloud-based systems, new complexities and challenges surface. To ensure that cloud security professionals have the required knowledge, skills and abilities to audit, assess and secure cloud infrastructures, (ISC)² and the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) recently developed the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSPSM).
The CCSP credential reflects in-depth knowledge derived from hands-on information security and cloud computing experience. It validates practical know-how for professionals whose responsibilities involve cloud security architecture, design, operations and service orchestration.
CCSP defines the qualifications and experience necessary to competently secure cloud services. Ultimately, it provides a new benchmark for cloud security knowledge and competence and is viewed as the most reliable indicator of overall proficiency in cloud security. 
This course is part of the Cybersecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Business agility refers to the ability of an organisation to succeed in a rapidly changing environment, by providing the required culture and supporting practices. Business agility builds upon practices that are widely used in software development to improve efficiency and speed to market and innovation.
The benefits of enhanced agility include higher revenues, more satisfied customers and employees, improved operational efficiency and faster time-to-market.
Business agility, hence, must be addressed organisation-wide and not be limited to IT, although IT serves as the key enabler of digital transformation. Agile organisations that are effective are both stable (resilient, reliable and efficient) and dynamic (fast, nimble and adaptive). Research shows that stability and dynamism are significant catalysts for organisational health and performance. Agile organisations also appear to be better at innovation, according to the best research.
This course will present the importance of business agility in relation to digital transformation and provide guidance on extending Agile practices across the organisation. A proven approach for establishing an Agile organisational culture will be discussed. We will discuss best practices for managing change as the organisation carries out its transition from the current to the desired Agile state.
This course is designed for use in a Bootcamp, which can be tailored for specific organisational needs, and a part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Today, more organisations are adopting Agile development and the trend is expected to continue. Agile development streamlines process overhead and improves predictability through better risk management.
Some popular Agile flavours today include Scrum and XP. Although these flavours describe in details the steps in Agile development, they do not elaborate on how to manage the requirements. This Business Analysis for Agile Practitioners course has been designed to introduce participants to the entire Agile development process, with a focus on requirements.
Through this course, participants will also be equipped with knowledge and skills to effectively perform business analysis in Agile projects. Participants will learn how to write and validate user stories. They will also be engaged in hands-on sessions to help facilitate and enhance the learning process.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Agility Series offered by NUS-ISS, and is not recommended for those who have already attended NICF - Certified ScrumMaster course or Certified Scrum Product Owner course.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn:
13 Professional Development hours (PD Hours) for the initial CBAP® application and Continuing Development Units (CDUs) for re-certification under IIBA®

Note: NICF-Business Process Reengineering (SF) for Health Services is next scheduled for 8-10 May
Business Processing Reengineering (BPR), as defined by Michael Hammer, is the fundamental re-thinking and radical redesign of business processes to bring about dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service and speed. With the resurgence of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) fuelled by machine intelligence, BPR is again centre stage as many companies will need to rethink their existing business processes in the light of digital transformation prior to automating it.
ISS is recognised as the most established institution with experience in offering the BPR course, having trained more than 10,000 people in Singapore over the past two decades. Participants have leveraged BPR to impact many industries including finance, healthcare, logistics and government. This course is taught by highly experienced instructors, who are former consultants from leading consulting firms with more than 10 years of experience in running BPR projects.
In this course, participants will learn why BPR is in demand, when to and when not to use BPR and more importantly, how to do it effectively and successfully. Beyond just theory, you will benefit from rich class notes and unique case studies. You will also benefit from the sharing of real-life scenarios, tips and techniques to help you avoid the many pitfalls of BPR and how to overcome the many challenges when implementing it.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 17 PDUs (PM: 14.75, Leadership: 2.25) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.

As organisations are highly dependent on IT to drive many business processes, the need for regulatory compliance and risks mitigation is made even more crucial. As the most widely used international framework of best practices for IT governance, Control Objectives for Information and related Technology (COBIT®) lets you bridge the gaps among control requirements, technical issues and business risks.
The COBIT® Certificate course is a 3-day programme that introduces you to the fundamentals of the COBIT® governance framework for IT. It covers topics required for the foundation certification and also relates the fundamentals of COBIT to real world examples.
A workshop and mock examination give you guided practice in applying COBIT to a case scenario and preparation for the certification examination. Past participants include IT Managers from public and private organisations in Singapore and abroad, providing good networking opportunities and experience sharing.
With the publication of the latest version - COBIT 5 - ISACA has taken the opportunity to update the framework for the current challenges facing organisations, as well as standardising and simplifying the COBIT structure. The course instructors are COBIT® certified and are experienced in implementing COBIT® in private and public sector organisations. This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 18 PDUs (Business: 18) that can be used to maintain your PMP®credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.
Should course participants wish to report CPE credits to ISACA®, the relevant CPE credits for this course would need to be submitted under the category of ‘Non-ISACA®professional education activities and meetings’. While the total training hours, exclusive of breaks and lunches, for the course is 19.5 hours, participants should refer to the below ISACA® guidelines on the relevant hours which can be reported for their respective ISACA certifications and the calculation of the hours:

The introduction of new technologies and the continual evolution of existing IT systems presents incredible opportunities and simultaneous challenges to the modern organisation. Technology alone cannot transform a business. It is critical that the people involved in the implementation and utilisation of new solutions are willing to embrace them as well. An understanding of change management principles can greatly improve the project manager’s chance of success in introducing IT or digital change.
In a rapidly changing business environment driven by IT and digitalisation, the ability for a business to continually adapt to take advantage of new opportunities requires the development of a strong change culture and a skilled, change-ready workforce. This not only helps to ensure success but just as critically helps to avoid being left behind and rendered obsolete. The effective application of change management and communication techniques to IT and digitisation projects will significantly improve the chance of success for change initiatives. Thus, managers who are leading change management project teams must be equipped with the necessary skills and appropriate toolkit to embark on the transformation journey.
This course draws extensively upon the practitioner experience of our lecturers. Having delivered complex, large scale change programmes locally and internationally, our course lecturers will share the frameworks and tools they have applied in industry settings. In the process, common pitfalls will be highlighted, with expert advice on how to overcome or avoid them.
The course is designed to address the particular challenges associated with the implementation of new IT systems or technologies, although the principles of change management, and the frameworks taught, could be applicable for all change management situations. The programme is delivered using blended learning techniques including experiential role-play, and hinges around IT case study activities to support participants in practical application of the skills taught.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership and Digital Products & Platforms Series offered by NUS-ISS. Series offered by NUS-ISS.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19.5 PDUs (Business: 12.5, Leadership: 7) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.",,"Key Takeaways

As organisations embrace the digital revolution, so do cyber criminals. Malicious cyber activities have evolved in sophistication, and stealth and teamwork are required to counter this. Not only cybersecurity professionals, ICT professionals too need to play their part in helping their organisations protect their assets from the ever-pervasive cyber threats.
The objective of this course is not to turn ICT professionals into cybersecurity professionals, but to equip them with sufficient cybersecurity knowledge so that they can incorporate security into their work at the outset rather than as an afterthought or, worse still, not at all.
This course is not recommended for those who have already attended NICF- AISP Qualified Information Security Professional Course

In our current digitally disrupted era, cybersecurity has now become more critical and the stakes are much higher. Daily cyber attack occurrences demonstrate the risks posed by cyber-threats – from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.
Investing in cyber technology alone to address cyber threats is no longer sufficient. The biggest risks of cyber attack lies in the effective management of humans – the weakest link in cyber threat. This requires putting in place the right governance and the right supporting processes, along with the right enabling cyber technology. Such complexity cannot be an excuse for anyone within an organisation to differ accountability and responsibility to technical “experts” – the cybersecurity professionals. It is essential that the organisation takes control of allocating the right resources to address cyber threats, actively manage governance, risk and responses to cyber threats and incidents. This includes creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises that cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility – no exception.
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment. 
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints. 
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 10 PDUs (Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting, the PMI® REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Note: NICF-Digital Transformation Planning (SF) for Health Services is next scheduled for 10-12 July
The pace of digital disruption in today’s environment is such that digital transformation is needed to enable technology advancements, together with physical and digital assets, to improve customer experience and thereby create a competitive advantage for organisations. The process of Digital Technology Planning helps to identify gaps and build bridges between people, process, technology and increasingly, information. This enables organisations, if not the opportunity to be disruptors, the ability to withstand any disruptions that come their way.
This course examines an organisation and how it can embrace digital in the pursuit of value creation. It introduces tools for internal and external analysis to help identify digital opportunities. An architectural approach is then taken to create a transformation plan.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as the Professional Diploma in Smart Health Leadership offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

Technology such as data analytics, mobility, social media and smart embedded devices are radically transforming businesses and government. It is changing business-customer, business-business, government-citizen and people-people interactions. It is also changing business models, business processes, customer behaviours and government policies. However, although technology presents new opportunities, it also creates new challenges including that of cybersecurity resiliency.
In today’s digital environments and smart cities, technological changes are digitally disrupting how business is conducted. They open the door to a flood of data such as traffic flow, energy use, water consumption, spending habits, search patterns, browsing history, etc. These pose security issues, raise privacy concerns and threaten the safety of our critical information and infrastructure operational capability.
This course seeks to answer these challenges by providing a firm understanding and practice of enterprise digital governance mechanisms. The essence of enterprise digital governance enables the creation of a flexible system for maintaining accountability, roles and decision-making in the face of technological changes and to create value from the effective and sustainable use of assets.
This course is part of the Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

With Singapore’s push towards international connectivity and the pervasive adoption of digital technologies as recommended by Committee on Future Economy (CFE), we inadvertently expand our cyber attack surface. Singaporean organisations and Singapore citizens are thus more exposed to global threats posed by cyber threats – from individual, opportunistic hackers, to professional and organised cyber criminals groups with strategies to systematically steal intellectual property, disrupt businesses and even threaten our safety.
In today’s digital business environment, cyber attacks can cripple the entire business operations if an organisation is unprepared. Investing in cybersecurity technology alone is insufficient to address cyber threats. Creating an informed and knowledgeable organisational culture that emphasises cybersecurity is a must for the entire organisation, and with business/operational leaders taking the lead is now an imperative.
This course is designed to provide you with the necessary skills to implement the right cybersecurity strategy and action plans, taking into considerations your business environment, your business and the potential cyber threats that will affect the business operations in the digital economy. In addition, it provides a detailed prescriptive framework which includes Incident Response Plan (using industry best practices) and a Cyber Maturity Model, instead of knowledge sharing without an approach to application. How public and private enterprises can play a role in ensuring that Singapore remain cyber resilience will also be discussed.
This course is part of the CyberSecurity and Digital Strategy & Leadership Series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment. 
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints. 
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 10 PDUs (Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting, the PMI® REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Many organisations develop software using an Agile methodology.
An Agile software development approach is characterised by iterative and incremental development to achieve significant productivity benefits, such as faster time-to-market and cost & time savings.
The Agile approach's benefits to the organisation are:
Increased ability to plan and deliver changes based on business priorities
Greater responsiveness with the ability to respond to changing priorities or urgent updates
Higher visibility of progress to all stakeholders
The confidence that they are building the right solutions by allowing them to explore new ideas and test them quickly with significantly less effort and cost
A delivery process that significantly lowers the risk of delivery, compared to traditional 'big bang' releases at the end of a long project
Improved ability to commit to and meet delivery deadlines
The ability to deliver new functionalities to their customers faster and with less lead time
A software testing practice that follows the principles of Agile software development is called 'Agile Testing'. An Agile framework, such as Scrum, is an iterative approach for software development, where requirements and designs evolve through collaboration between the customer and self-organising project teams.
Agile Testing focuses on identifying and repairing defects when they are detected, rather than waiting for a later stage in the project. By doing so, the product's quality will increase and development costs and efforts will go down. Agile practices, such as daily meetings can help to identify issues and defects early.
This three-day course will provide training and testing activities related to Agile projects and on applying tools and techniques to ensure that software products meet the accepted quality level (AQL).
Advantages of Agile Testing:
Improves quality
Saves time and money
Reduces documentation
Team gets regular feedback from end users
This course is part of the Software Systems series and Digital Agility series offered by NUS-ISS.","Upcoming Classes

As mobile adoption grows, so do security threats. Mobile devices are already an essential tool carried or worn by users worldwide and displacing conventional computers for everyday needs. With the number of smartphones and tablets on the increase, attacks on mobile devices are maturing. Gartner predicts that the focus of endpoint breaches will shift to smartphones and tablets in this year.
Mobile devices are affected by a range of security vulnerabilities, many of which are inherited from traditional attacks against web and desktop applications. However, several other classes of attack are specific to the mobile area and arise due to the way in which mobile applications are designed and the relatively unique entry points and attack surfaces that these applications create.
This course provides a technical review of the top security risks and controls to the iOS, Android and WebView mobile platforms, mobile apps development and integration to the enterprise that every IT professional needs to know. By combining lectures with discussion and hands-on workshops, the course prepares the mindset of participants to review the proposed mobile security architecture for businesses.

Mobile devices have become the essential delivery platform for business. Businesses recognise that mobility solutions are becoming their main channel when reaching out to their employees, customers and partners. The driving forces include improving internal communication, boosting customer retention, increasing speed of decision-making, reducing costs, improving efficiency and acquiring new customers.
Therefore, we are convinced that mobility is the way of life. The question is how to extend our enterprise services onto the mobile platform. There is already a set of existing mature and stable enterprise web applications. However, do we duplicate the services onto the mobile platform? Do we redesign part of or all of the applications? Or do we simply make our web applications adaptable to the mobile browser? There is also a need to decide which mobile platform to adopt - mobile web or native app, as well as which backend solution platform is most suitable and affordable.
This course aims to equip the participants with knowledge in designing mobile enterprise solutions, evaluating mobile development technologies and identifying security concerns pertaining to mobile enterprise solutions. With this knowledge, the participants will be able to evaluate their existing suite of traditional and web application, and redesign them for the mobile platform. They would be able to compare and contrast different mobile development technologies and select the appropriate one for their organisation, based on their needs.
The course will be conducted with a significant proportion on the hands-on workshop, which will walk participants through topics like mobile application design, development platform evaluation and security consideration. It will deepen the participants' understanding of how to apply the unique characteristics of mobile solutions in an enterprise environment.

‘Internet of Things’ or IoT is a key foundation of the Smart Nation in Singapore. IoT can enrich the digital landscape to improve quality of life and business efficiency. IoT provides the sensing and intelligence capability to monitor events of interest, process the events and take appropriate action – all of which can be done automatically. Knowledge of IoT and its enabling technologies, and how best to use them, will support organisations to achieve the vision of the Smart Nation. Organisations such as government ministries, MNCs and startups will benefit from knowing how best to envision and implement IoT solutions effectively to meet the needs of their users. 
In order to utilise the capabilities of IoT within the Smart Nation, it is important to be able to envision suitable applications and to be equipped with knowledge of being able to use practices such as Service Design to conceptualise solutions to real world challenges in a user-centric manner. 
The course will cover IoT’s enabling technologies and how they can be best utilised from an architectural viewpoint. The focus of the course is on envisioning suitable application of IoT technologies in a variety of ‘real world’ scenarios. The course covers cloud-based IoT services which provide functionality for building and operating IoT solutions in an efficient and scalable manner. 
The course will demonstrate how IoT has been applied in different situations across the globe and highlight significant IoT initiatives in Singapore. Case studies and workshops will reinforce the learning and enable participants to envision how IoT can be utilised for their own use cases.

Delving straight into system development without applying proper analysis and design is similar to building a house without a blueprint. This would mean having to spend more time and resources on reworks and patches later in the development phase in order to solve problems that could have been avoided if appropriate development techniques had been applied.
The Object Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) techniques helps to:
Speed up software development processes
Increase developers’ productivity by promoting software reuse
Facilitate effective software integration
Reduce software maintenance and enhancement efforts
Support continuous integration and delivery
Workshops are specially tailored to take participants through the system development process; from requirements to design workflow. Participants will get hands-on experience on the application of OOAD techniques through the relevant cycles.
This course not only helps system designers and developers to leverage on the benefits of OOAD techniques, thereby reducing maintenance costs and increasing software quality, it also helps project managers / leaders / Scrum masters / team members to better manage software development processes.
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 19 PDUs (PM: 19) that can be used to maintain your PMP® credential. Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting by those with PMP® credentials, the PMI REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.

Just as buildings are constructed using proven designs, software too can be built utilising proven solutions to common problems. Reapplying design pattern solutions to new applications reduces the development cost and lends itself to extensibility.
This course teaches participants to solve tough design problems by adapting proven designs called design patterns. By reusing proven solutions on the right problems in the right contexts, you will be able to solve design problems that you may not have been able to do previously.
This course provides an in-depth look into how experts apply design skills. A case study and a programming exercise will provide an opportunity for hands-on design discussions.
Design patterns should be applied whenever a new software application is being architected and designed. They should also be applied when there is a need to ‘refactor’ or improve existing software applications. The course highlights the relevance of design patterns in both contemporary and agile software engineering lifecycles.

In light of heightened information security concerns, software development lifecycle processes must be approached through implementation of ‘Secure by Design’ practices.
Without such focus on designing secure software applications, security exposures may lead to serious breaches or costly redevelopment. 
Hence, software developers must be trained to understand security concerns, where they may impact on the solution, and be able to implement the application in a security-aware manner. They must also be able to conduct security risk assessments and incorporate suitable mitigation measures in their software design.
Software is increasingly being developed within an agile project framework, such as Scrum. Such frameworks encourage iterative and incremental development in multiple iterations or sprints. 
The objective of this course is to instill ‘Secure by Design’ practices into the agile software development process so as to enable the team to produce applications that meet security requirements.
This course is part of the Cybersecurity series, Software Systems series, Digital Strategy & Leadership series as well as Graduate Certificate in Securing Ubiquitous Systems series offered by NUS-ISS. 
Upon successful completion of this course, you will earn 10 PDUs (Technical: 8.5, Strategy: 1.5). Note that for the purpose of PDU reporting, the PMI® REP Provider Number of ISS is “2339”.","Upcoming Classes

Machine Learning uses techniques to deal with data in the most intelligent way – by developing algorithms – to derive actionable insights. With machine learning, you can glean useful patterns from the deep, focused troves of data specific to your chosen domain. Analysing that data provide insights that can drive successive new waves of efficiency and automation, reducing operational costs and potentially pinpointing new sources of revenue.
This course is part of a series of courses around Machine Learning-driven Data Science (MLDDS), under the StackUp – Startup Tech Talent Development programme offered by NUS-ISS.
The courses in the MLDDS series are:
NICF – Data and Feature Engineering for Machine Learning (SF) [this course]
NICF – Supervised and Unsupervised Modeling with Machine Learning (SF)
NICF – Feature Extraction and Supervised Modeling with Deep Learning (SF)
NICF – Sequence Modeling with Deep Learning (SF)
Throughout all courses, you will experience the 3 building blocks in machine learning: 
Concepts and intuition: Participants learn and apply the concepts of machine learning using a methodology. You will learn to navigate smoothly through the data sciences and machine learning space by not only creating but also debugging your products with ease. You will then apply the same concepts covered in a real world scenario while in class.
Architecture: Participants learn what is required to architect a data science platform/team and how to effectively design a machine learning driven data sciences product using a wide range of techniques that are taught and practised in class. This includes, but is not limited to, understanding different parts of a data science product. The main goal of this course is to provoke thinking, establish the context of learning with the objective of developing and enhancing your capabilities in establishing a machine learning product.
Implementation: Finally, participants will have the opportunity to apply the concepts using industry standard libraries and tools to develop their own machine learning driven data science project.","Upcoming Classes

As the internet has evolved from a collection of static documents to an ecosystem of connected services and data providers it has brought with it the API revolution. APIs serve as the fabric that interlinks data flow on this modern evolution of Internet. They provide access to services that drive all of the interactions that we all take for granted when we do everyday tasks such as set up a calendar event on our laptops and have it instantly appear on our smartphones, wearable devices, and even our home appliances.
In this RESTful API Design course, students will learn to explore, identify, consume and implement REST API resources using common industry standard tools. Students will examine a variety of popular APIs to help understand how and where they are used. Students will also get the opportunity to consume public APIs and implement their own APIs in language of their choice.
The course will also cover API design, caching techniques and securing the API endpoint.
By the end of this 4 day course, you will have a thorough understanding of API, how they work and how to implement them efficiently in your application.

As we deliver more applications and services through the Internet, so do security threats. In the first part of this course, we will learn about security concepts, like authentication and authorisation, and how to implement them in a web application.
This portion will cover authentication, token-based authorisation, role-based security, and much more.
The second part of the course will delve into service workers - a programme that runs in the background. It is an essential part of Progressive Web Application, a framework for developing modern HTML5 applications. The course will cover notifications, specifically web notifications. Notifications allow an application to push data in the form of messages to a user, regardless of whether they are using a browser or mobile phone. We will look at how to send and receive these push notifications.

Machine Learning uses techniques to deal with data in the most intelligent way – by developing algorithms – to derive actionable insights. With machine learning, you can glean useful patterns from the deep, focused troves of data specific to your chosen domain. Analysing that data provide insights that can drive successive new waves of efficiency and automation, reducing operational costs and potentially pinpointing new sources of revenue.
This course is part of a series of courses around Machine Learning-driven Data Science (MLDDS), under the StackUp – Startup Tech Talent Development programme offered by NUS-ISS.
The courses in the MLDDS series are:
NICF – Data and Feature Engineering for Machine Learning (SF) 
NICF – Supervised and Unsupervised Modeling with Machine Learning (SF) 
NICF – Feature Extraction and Supervised Modeling with Deep Learning (SF)
NICF – Sequence Modeling with Deep Learning (SF) [this course]
Throughout all courses, you will experience the 3 building blocks in machine learning: 
Concepts and intuition: Participants learn and apply the concepts of machine learning using a methodology. You will learn to navigate smoothly through the data sciences and machine learning space by not only creating but also debugging your products with ease. You will then apply the same concepts covered in a real world scenario while in class.
Architecture: Participants learn what is required to architect a data science platform / team and how to effectively design a machine learning driven data sciences product using a wide range of techniques that are taught and practised in class. This includes, but is not limited to, understanding different parts of a data science product. The main goal of this course is to provoke thinking, establish the context of learning with the objective of developing and enhancing your capabilities in establishing a machine learning product.
Implementation: Finally, participants will have the opportunity to apply the concepts using industry standard libraries and tools to develop their own machine learning driven data science project.","Upcoming Classes

Find your fit with new opened doors
There is opportunity in Singapore for most areas of IT. What you learn in terms of IT skills is not as important as what you do with it. It is the attitude and the ability to learn from mistakes, and to contribute back to the company that you work for that is likely to make more of a difference than specific IT skills.
There are two main paths for advancement in IT - either technical or management. Technical means you continue to deepen your technical area in a domain (such as system architecture, or software engineering, etc.) and you become an expert in those areas. The other is management, where you can focus on project management, outsourcing, etc.
Our internship companies often tell us that if we can give them good students as interns, it is very likely they will get a job offer at the end of the internship.
Upon graduation, you will be trained IT specialists and leaders in real-world operating environments, equipped with invaluable problem solving, solutioning, and critical thinking skills. This would make you highly sought-after candidates of dynamic and successful multi-national corporations and institutions.

Find your fit with new opened doors
There is opportunity in Singapore in almost all industries which are rapidly working towards digital transformation and data analytics sits in the heart of it. What you learn in terms of analytics skills is not as important as what you do with it. It is the attitude and the ability to learn from mistakes, and to contribute back to the company that you work for that is likely to make more of a difference than specific analytics skills.
There are two main paths for advancement in analytics - either technical or managerial. Technical means you continue to deepen your technical area in a domain (Finance, Government, Manufacturing, Telecom, Transportation, Technology companies etc.) and you become an expert data scientist in those areas. The other is managerial, where you can focus on designing solutions for clients (internal or external) to achieve their organization goals in the areas of profit maximization, automation or digitization. 
Our internship companies often tell us that if we can give them good students as interns, it is very likely they will get a job offer at the end of the internship.
As an MTech EBAC graduate, you will be prepared for specialist, expert and leadership roles in enterprise business analytics to create business value through strategic use of data, visualisation methods, modelling techniques and frontline tools.

Find your fit with new opened doors
There is opportunity in Singapore for most areas of IT. What you learn in terms of IT skills is not as important as what you do with it. It is the attitude and the ability to learn from mistakes, and to contribute back to the company that you work for that is likely to make more of a difference than specific IT skills.
There are two main paths for advancement in IT - either technical or management. Technical means you continue to deepen your technical area in a domain (such as system architecture, or software engineering, etc.) and you become an expert in those areas. The other is management, where you can focus on project management, outsourcing, etc.
Our internship companies often tell us that if we can give them good students as interns, it is very likely they will get a job offer at the end of the internship.
As an MTech IS graduate, you will be trained to become an Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Engineering and data analytics specialist, leading the development of Intelligent Systems to provide smart business solutions for organisations.
